 NAME

    munin-host-rename - Rename a host in munin.

 Usage

    munin-host-rename <Hostgroup> <Old-Hostname> <New-Hostname>

    The script will do the following:

        * Create a backup of a given munin host's rrd files.
        * Rename the files to a given hostname
        * Purge out old html and png files
        * Regenerate the html and png files with the new hostname.

        NOTE: DISABLE MUNIN-CRON BEFORE YOU RUN THE SCIRPT.

 OPTIONS

    <Hostgroup>     specifies the munin group this host uses. Currently its not
                    yet supported to rename hosts without a group.

    <Old-Hostname> the old hostname or name which was used to identify the
                    host in munin.

    <New-Hostname> the new hostname to which the files should be migrated.


 ABOUT

    You need sudo privileges to run commands as munin user. You should as well
    disable munin-cron.

    I developed and tested this script on Debian/Lenny. It checks the
    environment quite well and asks you for confirmation before it does
    anything, so fell free to test it on other platforms too.
